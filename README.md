COBOL on Wheelchair
===================

Micro web-framework for COBOL.

OK, [COBOL-ON-COGS](http://www.coboloncogs.org/HOME.HTM) was funny, but why not try that for real? ;)

Things you'll need to run _COBOL on Wheelchair_:

* [GNU Cobol](http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/) (```sudo apt-get install open-cobol```)
* Access to cgi-bin directory on Apache server
